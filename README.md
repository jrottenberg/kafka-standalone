Kafka standalone
================

Based on [Kafka docker](https://hub.docker.com/r/ches/kafka/).

Intent
------

Intent was to keep it as simple as possible, just to let developer easily interact with kafka without the need to run docker-compose.

It's not following docker best practices (one service per container), but it allow to get you up and running with one container.

Production use Just don't ;-)
